
Anuj (AVP, Analytics) - Excellent code and documentation 
1. Document is well written 
2. All steps are properly explained 
3. IV and correlation matrix are properly calculated 
4. Model equation is properly documented 
5. Model performance is summarized 
6. Please note that he did the assignment in R and not in python 

Vishwadeep (AVP, Analytics) - Good code and documentation. There is scope to improve the code and documentation. 
1. Document is well written but is saved as html. Hence he could not include any charts or tables 
2. He has tried multiple ML models (Logistic reg, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, svm & artificial neural network)
3. hyper-parameter tuning was missing 
4. model summary and selection of final model was missing 

Prayush (AVP, Analytics) - Good code but poor persentation 
1. In the presentation - variable shortlisting and final model equation are missing 
2. He has included bi-variate analysis for each variable 
3. He has not mentioned in the email that gradient boosting is the final selected model (got to know after checking his code) 
4. In the call he said that he is not hands on coding, but here he has used lot of functions. My understanding is he borrowed the code / functions
