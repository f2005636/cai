## Task 1
To train a multi-class classifier on the dataset to predict the probability of **State**. There are 4,293 rows and 97 columns.

Based on the performance it can be concluded that the model performs a good job at classifying the State.
* The model has an accuracy of 1.0 and F1 score of 1.0
* The model has AUROC of 1.0 and Gini of 1.0

The codes, data and documentation are in the corresponding folder.   

## Task 2
Develop model to identify **real time failure**.
*	Supervised learning is used to identify the key factors or reasons behind the failure. 
*	Unsupervised learning can be used to understand where the errors are clustered. 
*	Paretoâ€™s Law is used to identify the top most reasons for failuer
